## About the Workshop

This is an introductory session on [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), a framework for large-scale data processing. We will introduce high level concepts around Spark, including how Spark execution works and itâ€™s relationship to the other technologies for working with Big Data. Following this introduction to the theory and background, we will walk workshop participants through hands-on usage of spark-shell, Zeppelin notebooks, and Spark SQL for processing library data. The workshop will wrap up with use cases and demos for leveraging Spark within cultural heritage institutions and information organizations, connecting the building blocks learned to current projects in the real world.

This workshop is a registration-only workshop as part of [Code4Lib 2018 in Washington, D.C.](http://2018.code4lib.org/). For registration information or other conference-level logistical questions, please check the [Code4Lib 2018 Registration page](http://2018.code4lib.org/general-info/attend). If you have questions about the workshop specifically, you can [contact the workshop leaders using the information below](#contact-before-during-after-the-workshop).

We ask that all participants come to the workshop ready to dive in by reviewing the information in this document.

## Contact Before, During, After the Workshop

If you have questions or concerns leading up to or after the workshop, please open an issue on this GitHub repository, particularly with any questions dealing with workshop preparation or any installation issues. This allows multiple workshop leaders to respond as able, and other participants can also learn (since we're sure the same questions will come up multiple times): https://github.com/spark4lib/code4lib2018/issues (this will require that you login or create a free account with GitHub).

During the workshop, we will indicate the best ways to get help or communicate a question/comment - however, this workshop is intended to be informal, so feel free to speak up or indicate you have a question at any time.

## Our Expectations of You

To keep this workshop a safe and inclusive space, we ask that you review and follow the [Code4Lib 2018 Code of Conduct](http://2018.code4lib.org/conduct/) and [the Recurse Center Social Rules (aka Hacker School Rules)](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules).

## Participant Requirements

We request that all participants:
 - **bring their own laptop**, preferably one you have installation or admin privileges on.
 - Have the software listed below (TBD) as well as an up-to-date modern web browser (basically, not Internet Explorer) on your laptop.
 - You should also fill out [this pre-workshop survey]() by **TBD Date** in order to help the facilitators best plan.

If you have any issues with the above, please contact us ASAP using the [communication methods detailed above](#contact-before-during-after-the-workshop).
